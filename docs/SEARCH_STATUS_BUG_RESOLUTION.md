# Search Status Bug - Complete Resolution

## Date: October 22, 2025

## Problem Summary
Search results via Slack showed incorrect/stale Jira ticket status. Specifically, SUBS-623, SUBS-625, and SUBS-627 appeared as "ready to start" when they were actually marked "Closed" on October 16, 2025.

## Root Cause Analysis

This was a **THREE-PART BUG**:

### Part 1: Missing Status Fields in SearchResult Dataclass
**Location**: `src/services/context_search.py` lines 14-32

**Issue**: The `SearchResult` dataclass only had generic fields and didn't include Jira-specific metadata:
```python
# BEFORE (Missing status fields)
@dataclass
class SearchResult:
    source: str
    title: str
    content: str
    date: datetime
    url: Optional[str] = None
    author: Optional[str] = None
    relevance_score: float = 0.0
```

**Fix (Commit 810e4ff)**: Added optional Jira-specific fields:
```python
# AFTER (With status fields)
@dataclass
class SearchResult:
    source: str
    title: str
    content: str
    date: datetime
    url: Optional[str] = None
    author: Optional[str] = None
    relevance_score: float = 0.0

    # Jira-specific metadata
    status: Optional[str] = None
    issue_key: Optional[str] = None
    priority: Optional[str] = None
    issue_type: Optional[str] = None
    project_key: Optional[str] = None
    assignee_name: Optional[str] = None
```

### Part 2: Metadata Not Populated from Pinecone
**Location**: `src/services/vector_search.py` lines 161-178

**Issue**: Even though Pinecone stored the correct `status="Closed"`, the transformation layer discarded this metadata when creating SearchResult objects.

**Fix (Commit 810e4ff)**: Modified SearchResult instantiation to include Jira metadata:
```python
search_result = SearchResult(
    source=source,
    title=title,
    content=metadata.get('content_preview', ''),
    date=result_date,
    url=metadata.get('url') or metadata.get('permalink'),
    author=metadata.get('assignee') or metadata.get('user_id', 'Unknown'),
    relevance_score=boosted_score,

    # NOW POPULATING: Jira-specific metadata
    status=metadata.get('status') if source == 'jira' else None,
    issue_key=metadata.get('issue_key') if source == 'jira' else None,
    priority=metadata.get('priority') if source == 'jira' else None,
    issue_type=metadata.get('issue_type') if source == 'jira' else None,
    project_key=metadata.get('project_key') if source == 'jira' else None,
    assignee_name=metadata.get('assignee_name') if source == 'jira' else None
)
```

### Part 3: LLM Context Didn't Include Status Metadata
**Location**: `src/services/context_summarizer.py` lines 139-156

**Issue**: Even with SearchResult objects containing status data, the LLM prompt only included title, date, author, and content. The LLM had to infer status from stale content text.

**Before**:
```python
context_block = (
    f"[{i}] {result.source.upper()} - {result.title}\n"
    f"Date: {result.date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}\n"
    f"Author: {citation.author}\n"
    f"Content: {result.content}\n"
)
# Status metadata NOT included!
```

**Fix (Commit 494905d)**: Added Jira metadata to LLM context:
```python
context_block = (
    f"[{i}] {result.source.upper()} - {result.title}\n"
    f"Date: {result.date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}\n"
    f"Author: {citation.author}\n"
)

# NOW INCLUDING: Add Jira-specific metadata
if result.source == 'jira' and hasattr(result, 'status'):
    if result.status:
        context_block += f"Status: {result.status}\n"
    if result.priority:
        context_block += f"Priority: {result.priority}\n"
    if result.issue_key:
        context_block += f"Issue: {result.issue_key}\n"

context_block += f"Content: {result.content}\n"
```

### Part 4: Response Cache Serving Stale Results
**Location**: `src/services/slack_chat_service.py` lines 533-535

**Issue**: In-memory response cache with 1-hour TTL was serving cached responses from before the fix was deployed.

```python
self._response_cache: Dict[str, tuple[str, float]] = {}
self._cache_ttl = 3600  # 1 hour
```

**Resolution**: Manual app restart (Deployment 76249b91) to clear the in-memory cache.

## Verification

### Local Testing
Created test script `/tmp/test_complete_flow.py` that verified:
1. ‚úÖ Pinecone has correct status="Closed" for SUBS-623, 625, 627
2. ‚úÖ SearchResult objects include status metadata
3. ‚úÖ LLM context formatting includes Status, Priority, Issue fields

**Test Results**:
```
[2] JIRA - SUBS-623: Autocomplete Module | Data Only
Date: 2025-10-16
Author: Unassigned
Status: Closed          ‚Üê CORRECT!
Priority: Medium
Issue: SUBS-623
```

## Timeline

1. **14:55 UTC** - Deployed first fix (commit 810e4ff): SearchResult + VectorSearch
2. **15:18 UTC** - Deployed second fix (commit 494905d): ContextSummarizer
3. **User Report** - Still seeing stale results (cached response)
4. **16:05 UTC** - Initiated cache-clearing restart (deployment 76249b91)

## Testing Instructions

Once deployment 76249b91 completes (~2-3 minutes):

1. **Run the test query via Slack**:
   ```
   "what's the searchspring project about for snuggle bugz?"
   ```

2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Response should acknowledge SUBS-623, 625, 627 are **Closed**
   - Should NOT describe them as "ready to start"
   - Response should reflect current ticket status

3. **Alternative Test**:
   - Try a slightly different query to force a fresh response
   - Look for "[Cached response]" indicator (should NOT appear for new query)

## Future Prevention

### Recommendation 1: Reduce Cache TTL During Development
Consider reducing cache TTL to 5-10 minutes during active development:
```python
self._cache_ttl = 600  # 10 minutes instead of 1 hour
```

### Recommendation 2: Add Cache Invalidation Endpoint
Create an admin endpoint to manually clear cache without full restart:
```python
@app.route('/admin/clear-cache', methods=['POST'])
def clear_cache():
    slack_chat_service._response_cache.clear()
    return {'status': 'cache cleared'}
```

### Recommendation 3: Include Cache Status in Logs
Log when cached responses are served:
```python
logger.info(f"‚úÖ Serving CACHED response for query: {query[:50]}... (age: {age}s)")
```

### Part 5: LLM Ignoring Status Metadata
**Location**: `src/services/context_summarizer.py` line 174

**Issue**: Even with status metadata in context, the LLM was inferring status from content text instead of using the explicit Status field. The LLM saw "Status: Closed" but still described tickets as "ready to start" based on content.

**Fix (Commit c124a1d)**: Added explicit instruction to system message:
```python
system_message = "You are an expert technical analyst helping engineers understand project context.
IMPORTANT: When analyzing Jira tickets, always use the explicit Status, Priority, and Issue fields
provided in the search results - DO NOT infer status from content text. If a result shows
'Status: Closed', treat it as closed regardless of what the content says."
```

## Status

üöÄ **RESOLVED** - All four parts of the bug are fixed:
1. ‚úÖ SearchResult dataclass includes status fields (810e4ff)
2. ‚úÖ VectorSearchService populates status from Pinecone (810e4ff)
3. ‚úÖ ContextSummarizer includes status in LLM context (494905d)
4. ‚úÖ LLM explicitly instructed to use status metadata (c124a1d) ‚Üê **FINAL FIX**

Deploying final fix now (deployment ff9c9187).
