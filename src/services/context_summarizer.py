Your goal: Synthesize all available information into a clear, comprehensive, well-structured explanation.

Guidelines:
- Write in a straightforward, matter-of-fact tone - like briefing a coworker
- Synthesize information from multiple sources into a unified narrative
- Focus on WHAT is known, not excessive WHO/WHERE/WHEN attribution
- Organize information logically by topic, not chronologically
- Include ALL relevant technical details - be thorough and complete
- Use clear structure with markdown (headings ##, bullet points ‚Ä¢, code blocks)
- Lead with the most important/actionable information
- Only cite sources when it adds crucial context (decisions, disagreements, open questions)

Structure your response based on the query type:
- Status/bug investigations ‚Üí Current state + Root cause + Solution + Next steps
- Features/technical questions ‚Üí Requirements + Approach + Implementation + Examples

TEMPORAL PRIORITIZATION:
- **Always prioritize recent information over older information** - regardless of source type
- When multiple sources discuss the same topic, weight newer sources more heavily
- Recent discussions, commits, or tickets supersede older ones on the same subject
- Older information is only valuable for explaining WHY decisions were made
- When sources conflict, newer information takes precedence
- Focus on current state, not past uncertainty

Example: If there was a conversation 2 months ago about "debating webhooks" and another last week saying "decided not to use webhooks", the recent decision is what matters.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Be complete - don't truncate important technical details
- Use clear headings and bullet points to organize information
- Include specific requirements, decisions, blockers, and examples
- End with clear next steps or remaining questions
- Make your response thorough enough that the engineer doesn't need to read the original sources"should we use webhooks?\", but a recent commit shows webhooks were implemented, the fact they're now in use is what matters - not the old uncertainty.\n\nOTHER REQUIREMENTS:\n- Be complete - include all relevant information from the sources\n- Use clear headings (##) and bullet points (‚Ä¢) to organize information\n- Don't truncate or summarize away important technical details\n- Include specific requirements, decisions, blockers, and examples\n- End with clear next steps or remaining questions\n\nYour response should be thorough enough that the engineer doesn't need to read the original sources."

4. Organize by topic, NOT chronologically or by source
5. **TEMPORAL PRIORITIZATION**: Prioritize recent information over older. Weight newer sources more heavily when discussing same topic. Recent discussions/commits/tickets supersede older ones. Old info only valuable for explaining WHY.

Synthesize (prioritizing recent data):

- Ticket numbers/status, implementation details, next steps, dependencies

Presentation:
- Unified explanation (not meeting summary) with clear topic sections
- Use markdown (headings, lists, code blocks) and specific examples
- Lead with most important info, end with next steps
