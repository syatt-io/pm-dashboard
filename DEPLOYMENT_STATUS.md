## 🔄 Current Status

**Deployment Phase**: Rolling out new containers

The DigitalOcean App Platform does **rolling deployments** which means:
- Old version continues running while new version starts
- Traffic gradually shifts to new containers
- Zero downtime deployment
- Takes 5-10 minutes typically

**Current Active Deployment**: `cca1c719...` (old version)
**In Progress Deployment**: `42db2394...` (new version with fixes)

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

Once deployment completes, verify:

### 1. Input Validation
```bash
# Should reject invalid input (>3650 days)
curl -X POST "https://agent-pm-tsbbb.ondigitalocean.app/api/backfill/jira?days=9999" \
  -H "X-Admin-Key: $ADMIN_API_KEY"
# Expected: 400 Bad Request with validation error
```

### 2. Rate Limiting
```bash
# Make 12 rapid auth requests
for i in {1..12}; do
  curl -X POST "https://agent-pm-tsbbb.ondigitalocean.app/api/auth/google" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"credential":"test"}'
done
# Expected: First 10 succeed (400 invalid token), last 2 get 429 (rate limited)
```

### 3. Database Backups
```bash
# Check backups are enabled
doctl databases list | grep agentpm-db
doctl databases backups list <database-id>
# Expected: See automated backups
```

### 4. CORS Configuration
```bash
# Check CORS headers
curl -I "https://agent-pm-tsbbb.ondigitalocean.app/api/health"
# Expected: Access-Control-Allow-Origin should be single production domain
```

### 5. Application Health
```bash
# Monitor logs for errors
doctl apps logs a2255a3b-23cc-4fd0-baa8-91d622bb912a app --type=run --tail=100
# Expected: No rate limiting errors, clean startup logs
```

| Time | Event | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 21:38 | Code pushed to GitHub | ✅ |
| 21:39 | Build started | ✅ |
| 21:42 | Build completed | ✅ |
| 21:42 | Container image uploaded | ✅ |
| 21:42-Now | Rolling deployment | 🔄 |

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Deployment is considered successful when:
- [ ] `InProgressDeployment` becomes empty
- [ ] `ActiveDeployment` changes to `42db2394...`
- [ ] Input validation rejects days=9999
- [ ] Rate limiting blocks after 10 requests
- [ ] No increase in error rate
- [ ] Health checks continue passing

---

## 🆘 Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If deployment fails:
```bash
# 1. Check recent deployment
doctl apps list-deployments a2255a3b-23cc-4fd0-baa8-91d622bb912a

# 2. Rollback to previous deployment
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# 3. Or manually trigger rollback in DigitalOcean UI
```

## 📝 Next Steps After Verification

Once deployment is verified working:

1. **Document Success** - Update this file with results
2. **Monitor for 24 hours** - Watch error rates, response times
3. **Move to Next Priorities** from `PRODUCTION_REVIEW.md`:
   - Fix SQL string formatting in migrations
   - Add deep health checks (PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, Pinecone)
   - Improve error handling (no stack traces in production)
   - Add request ID tracking
   - Increase test coverage to 70%+
